  # The make_request() and ec2_error? methods, which are shared by all, will raise any
  # exceptions encountered along the way as it converses with EC2.
  #
  # Exception Handling: If for some reason an error occurrs when executing a method
  # (e.g. its arguments were incorrect, or it simply failed) then an exception will
  # be thrown.  The exceptions are defined in exceptions.rb as individual classes and should
  # match the exceptions that Amazon has defined for EC2.  If the exception raised cannot be
  # identified then a more generic exception class will be thrown.
  #
  # The implication of this is that you need to be prepared to handle any exceptions that
  # may be raised by this library in YOUR code with a 'rescue' clauses.  It is up to you
  # how gracefully you want to handle these exceptions that are raised.

      # memory intensive and appeared to leak (the memory was not freed on subsequent requests).
      # It was changed to return the raw XmlSimple response.
