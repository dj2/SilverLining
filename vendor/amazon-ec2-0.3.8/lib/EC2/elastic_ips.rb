    # The ReleaseAddress operation releases an elastic IP address associated with your account.
    #
    # If you run this operation on an elastic IP address that is already released, the address
    # might be assigned to another account which will cause Amazon EC2 to return an error.
    #
    # Note : Releasing an IP address automatically disassociates it from any instance
    # with which it is associated. For more information, see DisassociateAddress.
    #
    # Important! After releasing an elastic IP address, it is released to the IP
    # address pool and might no longer be available to your account. Make sure
    # to update your DNS records and any servers or devices that communicate
    # with the address.
    #
    #Required Arguments:
    #
    # :public_ip => String (default : '')
    #
    #Optional Arguments:
    #
    # none

    # is assigned to the new instance. This is an idempotent operation. If you enter
    # it more than once, Amazon EC2 does not return an error.
